Figure 1 (PCA Projection): A 2D scatter plot showing the data reduced to two principal components, where points are grouped into two distinct clusters (blue and orange).

Figure 2 (Bar Charts): Two side-by-side bar graphs comparing the mean values of age, credit history length, income, and loan amount across the two identified clusters.

Figure 3 (Confusion Matrix): A heatmap visualizing the classification performance, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for labels "N" and "Y."

Figure 4 (ROC Curve): A line graph plotting the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate, indicating a strong model performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89.
